Pakistan Logistics Management Information System (LMIS) is an electronic logistics management system designed, developed and implemented indigenously to infuse efficency in Pakistan public health landscape.  The system is government owned and sustained system, providing updated and reliable supply chain data for vaccines, contraceptives and TB drugs for past more than 8 years. The application has evolved to capture real-time inventory data and product pipeline information to enable it to act as a critical supply management tool; whereby forecasting, quantification, pipeline monitoring and stock management functions are being performed by various government departments based on LMIS data. Over the years the system has started to move in to the centeral stage where multiple vertical stand alone information systems are being interfaced with it to draw consolidated information/analysis across the entire public health supply chain spectrum. 

LMIS was launched in July 2011 through USAID support. However, since then multiple donors e.g. WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, DFID and Gates Foundation have remained involved in LMIS scale-up, capacity building and data use; signifying its larger ownership not only in government but also among donors and UN agencies. 

The system is GS-1 compliant, supports threshold-based triggers/alerts as well as includes all needed supply chain features esp. pipeline and sufficiency of stocks in months of stocks, coverage, slice and dice reports and more. The system offers Zero vendor lock-in (LAMP Stack) with technical capacity available in the open market at a lower cost.  For generating user driven analytics (apart from built in reports) the system makes use of the pivot table and MS-BI 360 (Not included). This is the first step towards decoupling the modules so expect configuration glitches, however later plug and play VMs will follow.

# Document Management Module
One of the key elements of day to day working in the government offices is a file, which is used to process the cases. The document management module was developed to help EPI program to streamline the working of Immunization activities that ultimately save the lives of mother and children. The module covers the complete life cycle of the file from opening to its closure. The solution simulates the physical files as an electronic entity and provides fast searching of file subject and makes file movement transparent. It has a workflow system that is capable of handling any government office hierarchy. Document Management Module captures information and also attached images for fast retrieval of the noting. It also allows users to put remarks on the file. Complete history of the document movement and action taken on the document is maintained. The user can obtain the status of any document at any time.
